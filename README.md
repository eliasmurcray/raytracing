# Raytracing
I'll be trying to learn some raytracing concepts using SDL3 (window, events) and OpenGL (hardware-accelerated rendering), and following the tutorials in [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html). The code will be C89 compatible.

## Dependencies
- SDL3 ([Install Instructions](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/Installation))
- glew ([Releases](https://github.com/nigels-com/glew/releases))
- pkg-config
